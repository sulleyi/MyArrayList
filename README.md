This will be a short demonstration/tutorial using some of the concepts explained in Java Interludes 1-8. This demo is not necessary a good example of Java best practices, as  I will be implementing a class you can already import. For this example I will be writing my own MyArrayList<T> class, which will extend the class AbstractList<E> and implement the List<E> interface. This project will have example uses of generics, polymorphism, interface implementation, iterators, inheritence,as well as mutable and immutable objects.
